## Javascript Koans Problem Set

For this problem set, your challenge is to edit the code so that all of the expectations (specs) pass.
These specs are built using the jasmine testing framework. Each test follows a certain format.

The 'it' line contains a description of what the code should do.
The body of the test works like so:
expect(*the return value of this code being run*).toEqual(*this value*)

To start this problem set, open javascript-koans/KoansRunner.html in your browser. 
You will see that the first Koan "Thinking About Expects" is failing.

Open up javascript-koans/koans/AboutExpects.js to get started. Your challenge is to edit the code
so that each spec passes. In most cases you will need to change FILL_ME_IN and other times you will need to 
do something like change a parameter to a method call. 

For example the first Koan is 
`expect(false).toBeTruthy()` 

You need to change it to read
`expect(true).toBeTruthy()`

Open SpecRunner.html and see the first Koan turn green. Now on to the next one!
