##Pair-Programming Challenge: Build a Calculator

For this exercise, you will work with a partner to build a calculator in the browser,

There are two equally important goals for this segment:
1. Learn how to pair program effectively.
2. Build a working javascript app in the browser from scratch.

## Pair Programming Rules
Each team will consist of one student from each level. The Level 1 student will be the 'driver'
for the **entire duration** of the project. This means that the Level 2 student is not allowed to touch
the mouse or keyboard and must instead talk their way through the entire project.

Being able to effectively communicate about code is as important as being able to write it. 
Working on a software development team requires excellent communication skills.


##Calculator Specifications
Using HTML/CSS and Jquery, build a calculator that can peform the operatons +, -, * and /.
It should have buttons for the digits 0-9, a display window that shows the current input, a 'clear' button
that resets the calculation and a 'return' button that performs the calculation.

This assignment will require everything you've learned so far about javascript, the DOM and HTML/CSS. Good luck!
